    <dl>
      <dt>Why does NASA keep sending rovers to Mars?</dt>
      <dd>Because Mars is the most Earth-like planet we can reach with current tech. It’s a testbed for biology, geology, and long-term survival. Mars gives us answers about the past — and prepares us for future colonization.</dd>

      <dt>How are rovers controlled from Earth?</dt>
      <dd>Rovers aren’t controlled in real-time. There's a 5–20 minute delay each way depending on orbit. NASA engineers program sequences of instructions, which are then executed autonomously with hazard-avoidance routines built-in.</dd>

      <dt>Have any rovers ever found life?</dt>
      <dd>No rover has confirmed life. But missions like Curiosity and Perseverance have detected organic molecules and patterns in ancient rock that suggest Mars once had habitable conditions — and might still host microbial life deep underground.</dd>

      <dt>How do Mars rovers survive the harsh climate?</dt>
      <dd>NASA designs rovers to endure extreme cold, dust, and radiation. Most rely on solar panels (like Spirit and Opportunity) or nuclear power sources (like Curiosity and Perseverance) to stay functional through night cycles and dust storms.</dd>

      <dt>What happens after a rover dies?</dt>
      <dd>NASA tracks the last transmission. If it can’t reestablish contact over time, the mission is declared complete. But the data lives on — stored, studied, and used to design the next one better. Nothing sent to Mars is wasted.</dd>
