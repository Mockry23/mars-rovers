      <h2>Welcome to the Mars Rover Program</h2>
      <p>Since 1997, NASA has sent robotic rovers to Mars to explore the planet's surface, search for signs of water, and gather data about its geology and atmosphere.</p>

      <h2>Featured Rovers</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Curiosity</h3>
        <img src="images/curiosity.jpg" alt="NASA's Curiosity Rover" class="responsive" />
        <p>Curiosity isn’t just some passive piece of equipment—it’s been on Mars since 2012 rewriting everything we assumed about the planet’s potential to support life. It’s stationed in Gale Crater, but this rover doesn’t just sit still—it drills, it lasers, it sniffs the air. Its findings confirmed that ancient Mars had liquid water, a stable climate, and the chemical building blocks needed for life. It’s been silently pushing boundaries, doing the kind of fieldwork that human scientists can only dream of—alone, and on another planet.</p>

        <h3>Perseverance</h3>
        <img src="images/perseverance.jpg" alt="NASA's Perseverance Rover" class="responsive" />
        <p>If Curiosity opened the door, Perseverance walked through it like it owned the place. Touching down in Jezero Crater in 2021, it came equipped with the most advanced tools we’ve ever sent to another planet. It’s not just searching for ancient microbial life—it’s actively prepping Mars for future human missions. It dropped off the first interplanetary helicopter. It’s generating oxygen from the atmosphere. And it’s stashing rock samples for a return trip we haven’t even launched yet. Perseverance is less of a robot and more like a preview of everything coming next.</p>

        <h3>Spirit</h3>
        <img src="images/spirit.jpg" alt="NASA's Spirit Rover" class="responsive" />
        <p>Spirit was the rover that never gave up. It was supposed to last 90 days. It went for over six years. Through mechanical failures, harsh winters, and dust storms, Spirit kept transmitting images and data that deepened our understanding of Martian geology. It found proof of past water, climbed hills, and took some of the most iconic photos of the red planet before its final signal in 2010. If there's a definition of resilience in robotics, it's Spirit.</p>

        <h3>Opportunity</h3>
        <img src="images/opportunity.jpg" alt="NASA's Opportunity Rover" class="responsive" />
        <p>Opportunity was the overachiever of the rover fleet. Landed in 2004, it explored the Martian surface for nearly 15 years—uncovering hematite spheres, layered rocks, and the clearest evidence we’ve ever had of sustained water flow on ancient Mars. It traveled over 28 miles, broke records, and sent home more than 200,000 images. Its final message—“My battery is low and it’s getting dark”—wasn’t just poetic, it was unforgettable.</p>

        <h3>Sojourner</h3>
        <img src="images/sojourner.jpg" alt="NASA's Sojourner Rover" class="responsive" />
        <p>Sojourner was the prototype that proved the whole idea was possible. In 1997, it became the first rover to operate on another planet. It was small—about the size of a microwave—but it set the standard. It analyzed rocks, took panoramic images, and showed that we could drive a robot on Mars with delayed communication and limited power. Everything that came after owes a nod to Sojourner. It was humble, historic, and ahead of its time.</p>
